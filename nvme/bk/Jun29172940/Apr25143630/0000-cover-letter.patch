Subject: [PATCH 0/6] nvmet: configfs code clenaup and fix

Hi,

Over a period of time, configfs added different attributes and groups.
These groups and attributes have common type to name mapping
functionality with code and identical structures (see [1], [2] & [3]).
Where [1] and [2] adds a different structure which can be made generic
and can be resued by [3].

This patch-series adds a new generic structure for type to name mapping
which then used in the [1], [2] and [3] to align the code for 
consistency with removing the code duplication of
struct nvmet_transport name and struct nvmet_ana_state_names.
We also introduce a pattern with for-loop-compare-success-return with
type name map.

In short we address following points :-

1. Introducing generic type (identifier) to name (string) structure
   nvmet_type_name_map, by removing the private per attribute
   specific structures (nvmet_transport_name & nvmet_ana_state_names)
   for defining the type to name mapping.
2. Keeping the code consistent with the use of for loop and type-name
   struct array iteration instead ofÂ the duplicating strings in if/else
   latter and switch.
3. Having consistent coding pattern for type-name
   for-loop-check-success-return so that future introduction(s) of per
   attribute type-name will not add inconsistencies.

Regards,
Chaitanya
