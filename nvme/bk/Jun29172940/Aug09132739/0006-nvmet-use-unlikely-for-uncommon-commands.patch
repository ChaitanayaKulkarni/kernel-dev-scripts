Subject: [PATCH 06/13] nvmet: use unlikely for uncommon commands

I/O commands (nvme_cmd_read, nvme_cmd_write) are most common commands
when accessing passthru controller, most controllers should not
have set the effects for r/w I/O commnds (atleast I don't know at this
moment). Also, check for req->p.use_workqueue is true in two admin
commands only which are low frequency commands.

Annotate use_workqueue and command effects check with unlikely in the
fast path.
