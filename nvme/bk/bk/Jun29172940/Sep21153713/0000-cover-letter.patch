Subject: [PATCH V3 0/3] nvme: fix module ref count Oops

Hi,

I found the module ref count patch in the git without the ctrl get/put in
the nvme_dev_open/nvme_dev_release() with latest pull.

commit dfa76f46dad568ed81368c3cb810d95f820debc5 (origin/nvme-5.9)

    nvme-core: fix nvme module ref count Oops

In this series, the first patch which adds the ctrl get/put in
nvme_dev_open/release() which can be folded onto the git HEAD on
nvme-5.9 or applied separately deesn't matter.

The last two patches are Christoph's suggestion added on the top
host-core module count fix to decouple :-

 a. code for modue_get/put() in the passthru.
 b. lifting the file opening from the nvme-core.

Regards,
Chaitanya

Changes from V2:-

1. Add a patch to get/put ctrl reference in the nvme_dev_open/release().
2. Use Chritoph's suggestion to split the 2nd patch from V2 into :-
   a. module_get/put() in passthru enable/disable path.
   b. lifting the file open/close code from host/core for char device.  
3. Update patch subject.

Changes from V1: -

1. Move last patch to get the module refcount to start of the series.
2. De-couple the module refcount get/put from nvme_dev_open() and
   nvme_dev_release().

Chaitanya Kulkarni (3):
  nvme-core: get/put ctrl in nvme_dev_open/release()
  nvmet: get transport reference for passthru ctrl
  nvme: lift file open code from nvme_ctrl_get_by_path
