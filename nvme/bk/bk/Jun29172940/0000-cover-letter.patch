Subject: [PATCH V2 0/3] nvme: use xarray for ctrl->ns tracking

Hi,

As per out last discussion I tried running the numbers with the crntalize
spinlock they look suboptimal. What happens is when passthru controller has
1024 namespaces and from target we call nvme_find_get_ns() in the fast patch
all the threads get serialized on the xa_lock(&ctrl->namespaces) which leads
to the scalability issue.

This version has an hack which allows use to use the existing locking 
of the xarray and yet keep the current design with decoupling the code
for refcounts in the nvme_ns_remove().

Would like to know your thoughts whenever you get sometime.

I'm making this as my weekend project untill blktrace works finishes,
so no rush :).

Regards,
Chaitanya
