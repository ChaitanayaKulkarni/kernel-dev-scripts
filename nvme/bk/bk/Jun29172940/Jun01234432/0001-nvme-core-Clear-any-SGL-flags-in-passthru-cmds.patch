Subject: [PATCH 1/9] nvme-core: Clear any SGL flags in passthru cmds

The host driver should decide whether to use SGLs or PRPs and they
currently assume the flags are cleared after the call to
nvme_setup_cmd(). However, passed-through commands may erroneously
set these bits; so clear them for all cases.
