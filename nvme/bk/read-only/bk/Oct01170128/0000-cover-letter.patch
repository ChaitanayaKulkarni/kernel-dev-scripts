Subject: [PATCH 0/3] nvmet: allow target to export readonly ns

Hi,

This patch series allows target to export the read-only ns. The first
patch adds the new ns readonly configfs attr which user can set to make
ns read-only.

Last two patches allows user to open the ns in the read-only mode since
by default we open the ns in read-write mode which will fail if ns
device is set to read-only.

Regards,
Chaitanya
