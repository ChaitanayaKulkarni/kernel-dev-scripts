Subject: [PATCH V14 0/4] nvmet: add ZBD backend support 
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Hi Damien,

I've ran thelibzns testcases [1], as expected most of the testcases are
failing due to invalid status. Couple of testacses failed due to wrong
memory allocation in the libzns. Those fixes have been committed to
libzns and corresponding patches were sent to upstream to prevent such
faulty memory allocation from generating error. With Sagi's review those 
patches are applied in 5.13.

Even with the failed testcases I've not seen any crash or error.

Please review this version which has fixes for the comments that you
had.

Once we have internal reivew complete I can post it upstream.

Chaitanya Kulkarni (4):
  nvmet: add req cns error complete helper
  nvmet: add nvmet_req_bio put helper for backends
  nvmet: add Command Set Identifier support
  nvmet: add ZBD over ZNS backend support
