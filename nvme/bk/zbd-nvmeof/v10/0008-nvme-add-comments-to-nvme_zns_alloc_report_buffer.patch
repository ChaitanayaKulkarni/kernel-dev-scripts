Subject: [PATCH V10 8/8] nvme: add comments to nvme_zns_alloc_report_buffer

The report zone buffer calculation is dependent nvme report zones
header, nvme report zone descriptor and on the various block
layer request queue attributes such as queue_max_hw_sectors(),
queue_max_segments(). These queue_XXX attributes are calculated on
different ctrl values in the nvme-core.

Add clear comments about what values we are using and how they are
calculated based on the controller's attributes.

This is needed since when referencing the code after long time it is not
straight forward to understand how we calculate the buffer size given
that there are variables and ctrl attributes involved.
