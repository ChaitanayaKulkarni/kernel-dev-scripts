Subject: [PATCH V2 0/4] nvmet-auth: auth send / receive cleanup

Hi,

nvmet_execute_auth_send() and nvmet_exeucte_auth_receive() share a lot
of common functionality such as :-

1. Checking secp/spsp values and its error handling.
2. Initializing transfer buffer len and its error handling.
2. Allocating transfer buffer and its error handling.

This code is repeated in both the functions.

Add common helpers with very small restructring of code to remove
duplication of above functionality in the nvmet_exeucte_auth_receive()
and nvmet_execute_auth_send(), it also makes code easy to read as both
the functions are doing substantial work.

Please note that this series is generated on the top of this :-

    nvme-fcloop: no need to return from void function
    
    Remove return at the end of void function.

-ck

- Changes in V2:-

* add reviewe tags
* remove use of conditional operators in 3rd patch
* add a patch to fix the nvmet_sq->dhchap_step type fix from int -> u16

Chaitanya Kulkarni (4):
  nvmet-auth: use common helper to check secp/spsp
  nvmet_auth: use common helper for buffer alloc
  nvmet-auth: use helper for auth send/recv cmd prep
  nvmet-auth: use correct type for status variable
